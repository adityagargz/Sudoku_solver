Developed a Sudoku Solver web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask). The application features an interactive 9x9 grid that allows users to input Sudoku puzzles and solve them instantly with the click of a button. The back-end utilizes a backtracking algorithm implemented in Python to efficiently solve the puzzles. This project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack web development, algorithm implementation, and creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
